jasmine-node
======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tebriel/jasmine-node.png?branch=Jasmine2.0)](https://travis-ci.org/tebriel/jasmine-node)
![Dependencies](https://david-dm.org/tebriel/jasmine-node.png)

This node.js module makes the wonderful [Pivotal Lab's jasmine](http://github.com/pivotal/jasmine)
spec framework available in node.js.

jasmine
-------

Version `2.0.0` of Jasmine is currently included with node-jasmine.

requirements
------------

Requires version `10.x` of Node.js, please upgrade if you're on `0.8`, that's
just painful.

what's new
----------
*  90% Refactor, Convert to Coffee-Script
*  Isolate jasmine.js into a vm with a separate context for clean re-execution
     of specs
*  Now using Jasmine 2.0.0
*  Removed Support for RequireJS as it was buggy, confusing, and I'm pretty
     sure no one was using it.
*  Removed Support for Custom Helpers (have to be inside a beforeEach, this is
     a jasmine change, check out their docs on how to write one)
*  Removed Custom Timeout (jasmine has added a done function and
     `jasmine.DEfAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL`, just use that instead of expecting a
     test to take no longer than `x` milliseconds)
*  Removed TeamCity Reporter (no support for Jasmine 2.0) will be re-added when
     support is available
*  Removed JUnit Reporter (no support for Jasmine 2.0) will be re-added when
     support is available

install
------

To install the latest official version, use NPM:

```sh
npm install -g jasmine-node
```

usage
------

Write the specifications for your code in `*Spec.js` and `*Spec.coffee` files in the `spec/` directory.
You can use sub-directories to better organise your specs. In the specs use `describe()`, `it()` etc. exactly
as you would in client-side jasmine specs.

**Note**: your specification files must be named as `*spec.js`, `*spec.coffee` or `*spec.litcoffee`,
which matches the regular expression `/spec\.(js|coffee|litcoffee)$/i`;
otherwise jasmine-node won't find them!
For example, `sampleSpecs.js` is wrong, `sampleSpec.js` is right.
You can work around this by using either `--matchAll` or `-m REGEXP`

If you have installed the npm package, you can run it with:

```sh
jasmine-node spec/
```

If you aren't using npm, you should add `pwd`/lib to the `$NODE_PATH`
environment variable, then run:

```sh
node bin/jasmine-node
```

You can also require jasmine-node as a node module

```javascript
jn = require('jasmine-node');
jn.run({specFolders:['./spec']});
```

The jasmine-node object returned contains a defaults object so that you can see
what the expected args are. Pass only the options you need (the rest will be
filled in by the defaults) to the `.run(<options>)` command and away you go!



You can supply the following arguments:
  *  `--autoTest`               -  rerun automatically the specs when a file changes
  *  `--coffee`                 -  load coffee-script which allows execution .coffee files
  *  `--help, -h`               -  display this help and exit
  *  `--junit`                  -  use the junit xml reporter
  *  `--match, -m REGEXP`       -  load only specs containing "REGEXPspec"
  *  `--matchAll`               -  relax requirement of "spec" in spec file names
  *  `--noColor`                -  do not use color coding for output
  *  `--noStackTrace`           -  suppress the stack trace generated from a test failure
  *  `--nunit`                  -  use the nunit xml reporter
  *  `--reporterConfig <file>`  -  configuration json file to use with jasmine-reporters
  *  `--verbose`                -  print extra information per each test run
  *  `--version`                -  show the current version
  *  `--watchFolders PATH`      -  when used with --autoTest, watches the given path(s) and runs all tests if a change is detected

Individual files to test can be added as bare arguments to the end of the args.

Example:

```bash
jasmine-node --coffee spec/AsyncSpec.coffee spec/CoffeeSpec.coffee spec/SampleSpec.js
```

jasmine-reporters options
-----------------

To use default options, just specify `--junit` or `--nunit`

If you want to configure, also use `--reporterConfig path/to/config.json`

### Example JSON File with known options ###

Please checkout the
[jasmine-reporters](https://github.com/larrymyers/jasmine-reporters) repo for
more configuration information and documentation

```json
{
    "savePath": "./junit-reports/",
    "consolidateAll": true,
    "consolidate": true,
    "useDotNotation": false,
    "filePrefix": ""
}
```

growl notifications
-------------------

Jasmine node can display [Growl](http://growl.info) notifications of test
run summaries in addition to other reports.
Growl must be installed separately, see [node-growl](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-growl)
for platform-specific instructions. Pass the `--growl` flag to enable the notifications.


development
-----------

Install the dependent packages by running:

```sh
npm install
```

Run the specs before you send your pull request and ensure all pass:

```sh
specs.sh
```
