jasmine-node
======

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/spaghetticode/jasmine-node.png)](http://travis-ci.org/spaghetticode/jasmine-node)

This node.js module makes the wonderful Pivotal Lab's jasmine
(http://github.com/pivotal/jasmine) spec framework available in
node.js.

jasmine
-------

Version `2.0.0` of Jasmine is currently included with node-jasmine.

what's new
----------
*  Now using Jasmine 2.0.0
*  Removed Support for RequireJS
*  Removed Support for Custom Helpers (have to be inside a beforeEach)
*  Removed Custom Timeout
*  Rewrote Terminal Reporter
*  Removed TeamCity Reporter (no support for Jasmine 2.0)
*  Removed JUnit Reporter (no support for Jasmine 2.0)

install
------

To install the latest official version, use NPM:

```sh
npm install jasmine-node -g
```

To install the latest _bleeding edge_ version, clone this repository and check
out the `beta` branch.

usage
------

Write the specifications for your code in `*.js` and `*.coffee` files in the `spec/` directory.
You can use sub-directories to better organise your specs. In the specs use `describe()`, `it()` etc. exactly 
as you would in client-side jasmine specs.

**Note**: your specification files must be named as `*spec.js`, `*spec.coffee` or `*spec.litcoffee`,
which matches the regular expression `/spec\.(js|coffee|litcoffee)$/i`;
otherwise jasmine-node won't find them!
For example, `sampleSpecs.js` is wrong, `sampleSpec.js` is right.

If you have installed the npm package, you can run it with:

```sh
jasmine-node spec/
```

If you aren't using npm, you should add `pwd`/lib to the `$NODE_PATH`
environment variable, then run:

```sh
node lib/jasmine-node/cli.js
```


You can supply the following arguments:
  * `--autoTest`         - rerun automatically the specs when a file changes
  * `--watch PATH`       - when used with --autoTest, watches the given path(s) and runs all tests if a change is detected
  * `--noColor`          - do not use color coding for output
  * `-m, --match REGEXP` - load only specs containing "REGEXPspec"
  * `--matchAll`         - relax requirement of "spec" in spec file names
  * `--verbose`          - print extra information per each test run
  * `--coffee`           - load coffee-script which allows execution .coffee files
  * `--forceExit`        - force exit once tests complete.
  * `--captureExceptions`- listen to global exceptions, report them and exit (interferes with Domains)
  * `--noStackTrace`     - suppress the stack trace generated from a test failure
  * `--version`          - show the current version
  * `-h, --help`         - display this help and exit

Individual files to test can be added as bare arguments to the end of the args.

Example:

```bash
jasmine-node --coffee spec/AsyncSpec.coffee spec/CoffeeSpec.coffee spec/SampleSpec.js
```

async tests
-----------

jasmine-node includes an alternate syntax for writing asynchronous tests. Accepting
a done callback in the specification will trigger jasmine-node to run the test
asynchronously waiting until the `done()` callback is called.

```javascript
var request = require('request');

it("should respond with hello world", function(done) {
  request("http://localhost:3000/hello", function(error, response, body){
    expect(body).toEqual("hello world");
    done();
  });
});
```

An asynchronous test will fail after `5000` ms if `done()` is not called. This timeout
can be changed by setting `jasmine.getEnv().defaultTimeoutInterval` or by passing a timeout
interval in the specification.

```javascript
var request = require('request');

it("should respond with hello world", function(done) {
  request("http://localhost:3000/hello", function(error, response, body){
    done();
  });
}, 250); // timeout after 250 ms
```

or

```javascript
var request = require('request');

jasmine.getEnv().defaultTimeoutInterval = 500;

it("should respond with hello world", function(done) {
  request("http://localhost:3000/hello", function(error, response, body){
    done();
  });  // timeout after 500 ms
});
```

Checkout [`spec/SampleSpecs.js`](https://github.com/mhevery/jasmine-node/blob/master/spec/SampleSpecs.js) to see how to use it.


exceptions
----------

Often you'll want to capture an uncaught exception and log it to the console,
this is accomplished by using the `--captureExceptions` flag. Exceptions will
be reported to the console, but jasmine-node will attempt to recover and
continue. It was decided to not change the current functionality until `2.0`. So,
until then, jasmine-node will still return `0` and continue on without this flag.

### Scenario ###

You require a module, but it doesn't exist, ie `require('Q')` instead of
`require('q')`. Jasmine-Node reports the error to the console, but carries on
and returns `0`. This messes up Travis-CI because you need it to return a
non-zero status while doing CI tests.

### Mitigation ###

Before `--captureExceptions`

```sh
> jasmine-node --coffee spec
> echo $status
0
```

Run jasmine node with the `--captureExceptions` flag.

```sh
> jasmine-node --coffee --captureExceptions spec
> echo $status
1
```


growl notifications
-------------------

Jasmine node can display [Growl](http://growl.info) notifications of test
run summaries in addition to other reports.
Growl must be installed separately, see [node-growl](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-growl)
for platform-specific instructions. Pass the `--growl` flag to enable the notifications.


development
-----------

Install the dependent packages by running:

```sh
npm install
```

Run the specs before you send your pull request:

```sh
specs.sh
```

__Note:__ Some tests are designed to fail in the specs.sh. After each of the
individual runs completes, there is a line that lists what the expected
Pass/Assert/Fail count should be. If you add/remove/edit tests, please be sure
to update this with your PR.
